Python Client:
 - Ask the user to login with username and password
 	- Encode the password using basic authentication to /login only
	- Send the encoded password to the server
	- The server then decodes the password
	- Then server then checks whether the decoded password and username exists
	- Decides whether to return a 401 or a 200
		- If 200, it will return an authentication token 
		- JSON web tokens (bearer token)
		- If 401 then the account doesn't exist and your not authorised
	- Then for every request the client makes, the JSON web token must appear in the headers
		- Use std::maps to assign token to user
		- check if the token appears after logging in on the server
		- The client provides the client to the server and the server checks it
		- Make sure the user onl reads his messages
		- If the token doesn't appear, you return a 401
		- If the token don't match, return a 401
		- Else print all messages
	- You can have a token expiry policy on the server side
	- Turn you client into classes

- Most of your security considerations should be on the server side
	- THe client is usually on the users machine, thus you can't really controll what happens

Considerations:
- Think about encrypting network and the database(Password and Message)
